* **The flow is step-by-step.** You start by writing the chip’s behavior in a high-level way (C language). That’s like a blueprint—easy to test, quick to adjust.
* **RTL comes next.** The design is then translated into RTL (Verilog or similar), which is a closer description of actual hardware. This is still a “soft copy”—not yet silicon, but hardware in code.
* **Integration phase.** Here, all the blocks—CPU, memory, peripherals, analog parts—get wired together into a system. After synthesis, you get a netlist (a map of all the gates). Eventually, this leads to the GDSII file, which is what factories use to make the chip.
* **Physical implementation.** Now it’s a real chip that can run at working speeds. That same single chip design could power anything from a smartwatch to a TV panel.

Across all these stages, **testing happens repeatedly**. The testbench written in C keeps checking the design at every level, ensuring the final chip behaves exactly like the initial model.

So, the summary basically says:

* Start high-level (easy to think about).
* Gradually refine into hardware (more detailed, harder to change).
* Keep testing all the way.
* Result: one chip design that can be reused across many gadgets.
